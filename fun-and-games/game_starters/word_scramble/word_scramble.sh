# 🛠️ Try using these Continue code extension features:
# - Use the "Ask" tab to modify the shuffle logic (e.g., make it reusable for any word)
# - Ask: "How can I scramble and compare multiple words in Bash?"
# - Highlight the loop and use "Explain this" to understand how it handles user input
# - Use "Refactor this" to clean up the guess-checking logic or improve readability
# - Ask Continue: "Make the output more interactive with random praise or hints"

# === 💡 Extending the Application ===
# - Add a “best of 3” or score-tracking feature using a loop and counter
# - Provide clues (e.g., “It’s a programming language”) after a few wrong guesses
# - Use emojis or terminal colors (e.g., green for correct, red for incorrect) 🎨
