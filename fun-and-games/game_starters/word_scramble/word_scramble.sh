# === 🎯 WORD SCRAMBLE GAME - BASH VERSION ===
# 
# Start by asking Continue's chat:
# "Create a Bash script for a word scramble game that:
# - Takes a word (like 'python') and scrambles the letters randomly
# - Shows the scrambled word to the user
# - Lets the user guess the original word
# - Keeps asking until they get it right or type 'quit'
# - Shows a fun message when they win"
# You can directly copy and paste the above into the chat interface in the left-hand sidebar.
# After Continue creates your script, you can copy and paste it into this file and/or you can enhance it further!

# 🛠️ Once you have working code, try these Continue features:
# - In the Chat: Ask "How can I add multiple words?" or "How do I implement score tracking?"
# - Highlight any section → "Add Highlighted Code to Context" → Ask how it works
# - Highlight any section → "Edit Highlighted Code" → "add hints after wrong guesses"
# - Highlight the entire script → "Optimize this Code" for better performance
# - Highlight complex sections → "Write Comments for this Code" for clarity

# === 💡 Ideas to Enhance Your Game ===
# Ask Continue's chat to help you add these features:
# - Multiple words that get randomly selected
# - Score tracking across multiple rounds
# - Hints after several wrong guesses (e.g., "It's a programming language")
# - Terminal colors for feedback (green for correct, red for wrong)
# - Difficulty levels with longer words
