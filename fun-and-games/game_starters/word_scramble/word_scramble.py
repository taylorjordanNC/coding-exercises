# === 🎯 WORD SCRAMBLE GAME - PYTHON VERSION ===
# 
# Start by asking Continue's chat:
# "Create a Python script for a word scramble game that:
# - Takes a word (like 'python') and scrambles the letters randomly using random.sample()
# - Shows the scrambled word to the user
# - Lets the user guess the original word
# - Keeps asking until they get it right or type 'quit'
# - Shows a celebration message when they win"
# You can directly copy and paste the above into the chat interface in the left-hand sidebar.
# After Continue creates your script, you can copy and paste it into this file and/or you can enhance it further!


# 🛠️ Once you have working code, try these Continue features:
# - In the Chat: Ask "How can I add a list of words?" or "How do I implement score tracking?"
# - Highlight any section → "Add Highlighted Code to Context" → Ask about random.sample()
# - Highlight any section → "Edit Highlighted Code" → "add difficulty levels"
# - Highlight the entire script → "Optimize this Code" for better structure
# - Highlight any section → "Fix this Code" to check for edge cases

# === 💡 Ideas to Enhance Your Game ===
# Ask Continue's chat to help you add these features:
# - A list of words that get randomly selected each game
# - Score tracking across multiple rounds with leaderboard
# - Hint system that reveals letters after wrong guesses
# - Different difficulty levels (short vs long words)
# - Terminal colors using colorama library for better UX
