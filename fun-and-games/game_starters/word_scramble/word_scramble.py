# 🛠️ Try using these Roo Code features:
# - Use “Ask” to turn the scrambling logic into a reusable function
# - Ask: “How can I make this work with a list of words instead of just one?”
# - Highlight the while loop and use “Explain this” to better understand the input logic
# - Use “Improve this code” or “Refactor this” to make it cleaner or more modular
# - Ask: “Make the game more engaging with fun prompts and encouragement”

# === 💡 Extending the Application ===
# Try these with Roo Code after the game works:
# - Add a “best of 3” or score-tracking feature across multiple rounds
# - Give playful hints like “It starts with ‘p’...” or “You’re getting warmer 🔥”
# - Add emojis 🎉 or terminal color for win/loss messages for a more dynamic experience
