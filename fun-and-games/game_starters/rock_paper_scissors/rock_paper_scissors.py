# 🛠️ Try using these Continue code extension features:
# - Use "Ask" to turn this into a reusable function (e.g., play_round())
# - Ask: "How can I add score tracking and let the user play multiple rounds?"
# - Highlight the win/lose logic and use "Explain this" to break down how the outcome is determined
# - Use "Refactor this" to simplify the conditional logic or make the code cleaner
# - Ask Continue: "Add fun taunts, random victory messages, or terminal colors to the results"

# === 💡 Extending the Application ===
# Try these with Continue after the game works:
# - Add a loop to play best of 3 (or best of 5)
# - Handle unexpected inputs (e.g., typos or invalid choices)
# - Add terminal color for win/loss messages and tie (🎨)
# - Include emojis or randomized feedback (“Rock crushes scissors! 💥”)
# - Show a final win count or percentage after several rounds
