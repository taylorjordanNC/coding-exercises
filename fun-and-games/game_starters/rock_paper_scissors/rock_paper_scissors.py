# === 🎯 ROCK PAPER SCISSORS - PYTHON VERSION ===
# 
# Start by asking Continue's chat:
# "Create a Python rock paper scissors game that:
# - Uses random.choice() to pick the computer's move from ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']
# - Asks the user to input their choice
# - Compares the choices and determines the winner using game rules
# - Shows both choices and declares the result (win/lose/tie)
# - Uses fun emojis in the output messages"
# You can directly copy and paste the above into the chat interface in the left-hand sidebar.
# After Continue creates your script, you can copy and paste it into this file and/or you can enhance it further!


# 🛠️ Once you have working code, try these Continue features:
# - In the Chat: Ask "How can I add score tracking?" or "How do I create a play_round() function?"
# - Highlight any section → "Add Highlighted Code to Context" → Ask about the game rules
# - Highlight any section → "Edit Highlighted Code" → "simplify this logic"
# - Highlight the entire script → "Optimize this Code" for better structure
# - Highlight complex sections → "Write Comments for this Code" for clarity

# === 💡 Ideas to Enhance Your Game ===
