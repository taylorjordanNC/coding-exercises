# === 🎯 ROCK PAPER SCISSORS - BASH VERSION ===
# 
# Start by asking Continue's chat:
# "Create a Bash script for rock paper scissors that:
# - Uses an array ('rock' 'paper' 'scissors') and $RANDOM to pick computer choice
# - Reads user input with read -p
# - Uses if/elif statements to compare choices and determine winner
# - Shows both choices and declares the result with emojis
# - Handles all the rock paper scissors game logic"
# You can directly copy and paste the above into the chat interface in the left-hand sidebar.
# After Continue creates your script, you can copy and paste it into this file and/or you can enhance it further!

# 🛠️ Once you have working code, try these Continue features:
# - In the Chat: Ask "How can I add score tracking?" or "How do I create Bash functions?"
# - Highlight any section → "Add Highlighted Code to Context" → Ask about the logic
# - Highlight any section → "Edit Highlighted Code" → "make this more readable"
# - Highlight the entire script → "Optimize this Code" for better structure
# - Highlight complex sections → "Write Comments for this Code" for clarity

# === 💡 Ideas to Enhance Your Game ===
# Ask Continue's chat to help you add these features:
# - Best of 3 or endless mode with scoreboard tracking
# - Case-insensitive input handling (Rock, ROCK, rock all work)
# - ANSI color codes for colorful win/lose messages
# - Countdown timer before revealing computer's choice
# - Game statistics logged to a file
# - Different computer AI strategies (not just random)
