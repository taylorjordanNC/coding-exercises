# === 🎯 SIMPLE QUIZ GAME - BASH VERSION ===
# 
# Start by asking Continue's chat:
# "Create a Bash quiz script that:
# - Has 3 hardcoded questions with answers
# - Uses read -p to get user input
# - Uses ${variable,,} to convert answers to lowercase for comparison
# - Tracks score with a counter variable and ((score++)) increment
# - Uses if statements with [[ ]] for string comparison
# - Shows the final score at the end"
# You can directly copy and paste the above into the chat interface in the left-hand sidebar.
# After Continue creates your script, you can copy and paste it into this file and/or you can enhance it further!

# 🛠️ Once you have working code, try these Continue features:
# - In the Chat: Ask "How can I create Bash functions?" or "How do I use arrays for questions?"
# - Highlight any section → "Add Highlighted Code to Context" → Ask about functions
# - Highlight any section → "Edit Highlighted Code" → "simplify this pattern"
# - Highlight the entire script → "Optimize this Code" for better structure
# - Highlight complex sections → "Write Comments for this Code" for clarity

# === 💡 Ideas to Enhance Your Game ===
# Ask Continue's chat to help you add these features:
# - Question bank stored in Bash arrays, randomly shuffled
# - More flexible answer checking (partial matches, multiple correct answers)
# - Emoji feedback (✅ ❌) and ANSI color codes for visual appeal
# - Score-based encouragement messages
# - Question categories with different difficulty levels
# - File-based question storage that can be easily updated
