# === 🎯 SIMPLE QUIZ GAME - PYTHON VERSION ===
# 
# Start by asking Continue's chat:
# "Create a Python quiz game that:
# - Has 3 hardcoded questions with answers (like 'What is the capital of France?')
# - Uses input() to get user answers and .strip().lower() to clean them
# - Keeps track of the score with a counter variable
# - Uses if/else statements to check answers and give feedback
# - Shows the final score at the end (like '2/3 correct')"
# You can directly copy and paste the above into the chat interface in the left-hand sidebar.
# After Continue creates your script, you can copy and paste it into this file and/or you can enhance it further!

# 🛠️ Once you have working code, try these Continue features:
# - In the Chat: Ask "How can I use dictionaries for questions?" or "How do I reduce code repetition?"
# - Highlight any section → "Add Highlighted Code to Context" → Ask about patterns
# - Highlight any section → "Edit Highlighted Code" → "make this more efficient"
# - Highlight the entire script → "Optimize this Code" to improve structure
# - Highlight any section → "Fix this Code" to check for edge cases

# === 💡 Ideas to Enhance Your Game ===
# Ask Continue's chat to help you add these features:
# - Question bank stored in a dictionary or list, randomly shuffled
# - More sophisticated answer checking (partial matches, synonyms)
# - Score-based feedback messages (90%+ = "Excellent!", 50-89% = "Good job!")
# - Timer functionality to make questions time-limited
# - Categories of questions (history, science, programming)
# - Difficulty levels with different point values
