# 🛠️ Try using these Continue code extension features:
# - Use "Ask" to turn the repeated input logic into a reusable function
# - Ask: "How can I store the questions and answers in a dictionary or list?"
# - Highlight one of the if/else blocks and use "Explain this" to understand comparison logic
# - Use "Improve this code" or "Refactor this" to simplify repetition or improve structure
# - Ask Continue: "Add terminal colors or emojis for correct/incorrect answers"

# === 💡 Extending the Application ===
# Try these with Continue after the quiz works:
# - Shuffle the question order each time the quiz runs
# - Add more questions or load them from a file or list
# - Display feedback based on the final score (e.g. "Nice job!" or "Try again!")
# - Add a timer or countdown feature for an extra challenge ⏱️
# - Add emoji-based responses like ✅ or ❌, or color code the terminal output
